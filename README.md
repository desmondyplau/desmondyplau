# About Me
Hi, my name is Desmond. I am currently a final year software engineering student studying in Monash University. This is my personal GitHub account with informations to some of the interesting projects I've contributed to during my University degree and some personal projects I've made. You can contact me with the email desmondyplau@gmail.com.

# University Projects
## HeartSight Mobile App
A mobile app I helped developed within a large student team(17 people) for  a client for a masters Engineering student. The app was developed within Android Studio and done using the Java programming language. The app was created to interact with a wearable device using Bluetooth created by the client, the app intended to calculate the user's ECG value and store it within a Firebase cloud database.

## Adaptive SVG floor plan web app
For my capstone research project ([FIT4003](https://handbook.monash.edu/2021/units/FIT4003)) I was a part of a team to create an adaptive SVG floor plan focused on usability especially those with disabilities. The app itself was developed using the React framework using Material UI library, while the adaptive SVG map was generated using pre-exisiting floor plans and python. I conducted testing with people with disability during this project. You can access the web app itself [here](https://fit4003-group19.github.io/adaptive-svg/)

## AskPCOS extension
My capstone industry experience project([FIT4002](https://handbook.monash.edu/2022/units/FIT4002)) was to develop a goal-setting extension for the existing [AskPCOS](https://www.askpcos.org/) app. The AskPCOS app is a progressive web app developed using TypeScript and the React framework by MCHRI (Monash Center for Health Research and Implementation). Our extension aimed to digitalise the paper-based goal setting process, the stakeholders for this project include: The development team (My team and I), Design Team(A student team from [MADA](https://www.monash.edu/mada)) and the clients ([MCHRI](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/mchri)). This provided me an opportunity to work with teams of difference experiences and from different disciplines, it has also provided me an opportunity to further my understanding of React and AWS.


# Personal Projects
## Arduino Nixie Tube Clock Project
A project to replicate nixie tubes using LEDs, Acrylic, 3D printed parts. Within this project, I created my own PCB design and coded up a clock which interfaces with an Arduino and a RTC module. The project makes use of the Arduino programming language (C++) for coding and other project files include KiCAD PCB design files and 3D models to seperate the lights from each other. [Here](https://youtube.com/shorts/fZBMAkcnA2k?feature=share) is a short video of it working. 

## MACathon 2022
I attended the MACathon event ran by MAC(Monash Association of Coding), where my team and I were given 48 hours to develope a real world solution to the theme of: Code a better Australia. For our project, we created a web app which users can submit their COVID-19 cases which we store and put onto a hot map online. The inspiration behind this project is because the Victorrian government stopped releasing COVID-19 hot spots informations, so we thought to implement it ourselves.
This project was mainly written with a Java backend and a JavaScript front end. [Here](https://youtu.be/2nAsXqPRN90) is our submission video. Although, we did not win any prizes within the competition, it was a great learning experience with soft skills as my team was comprised of memebers whom I don't know.
