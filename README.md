# About Me
Hi, my name is Desmond. I am currently a final year software engineering student studying in Monash University. This is my personal GitHub account with informations to some of the interesting projects I've contributed to during my University degreen and some personal projects I've made. You can contact me with the email desmondyplau@gmail.com.

# University Projects
## HeartSight Mobile App
A mobile app I helped developed within a large student team(17 people) for  a client for a masters Engineering student. The app was developed within Android Studio and done using the Java programming language. The app was created to interact with a wearable device using Bluetooth created by the client, the app intended to calculate the user's ECG value and store it within a Firebase cloud database.

## Adaptive SVG floor plan web app
For my capstone research project ([FIT4003](https://handbook.monash.edu/2021/units/FIT4003)) I was a part of a team to create an adaptive SVG floor plan focused on usability especially those with disabilities. The app itself was developed using the React framework using Material UI library, while the adaptive SVG map was generated using pre-exisiting floor plans and python. I conducted testing with people with disability during this project.

## AskPCOS extension
My capstone industry experience project([FIT4002](https://handbook.monash.edu/2022/units/FIT4002)) was to develop a goal-setting extension for the existing [AskPCOS](https://www.askpcos.org/) app. The AskPCOS app is a progressive web app developed using TypeScript and the React framework by MCHRI (Monash Center for Health Research and Implementation). Our extension aimed to digitalise the paper-based goal setting process, the stakeholders for this project include: The development team (My team and I), Design Team(A student team from [MADA](https://www.monash.edu/mada)) and the clients ([MCHRI](https://www.monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/mchri)). This provided me an opportunity to work with teams of difference experiences and from different disciplines, it has also provided me an opportunity to further my understanding of React and AWS.
